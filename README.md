##  Generalized ResNet on CIRAF-10

This repository contains the experiments done in the work ***Generalized Training with Residual Learning on Image Classification*** by Haowei Jiang and Feiwei Qin.

We performed an ablation and comparison experiments on CIFAR-10. According to the results, we verify the effectiveness of Generalized ResNet.

### Notes

- The repository consists of experiment code, results and pre-trained models.

- There are also **experiment results** and **pre-trained models** placed in [results](https://github.com/WinnieJiangHW/Generalized-ResNet/tree/main/Test_results) directory.

- The code should be directly runnable with PyTorch v1.0.0 or above.
